Unfortunately, when booking I had not seen there is no lift in the property which made it harder for me to get to the top floor studio. But this was my error in not reading the advert correctly. A few things to remember - the shower has reduced pressure which can be a problem when you have long hair to wash! The corridor spaces are a little poorly lit and not finished to the same spec as the studio. Also, can be a problem if you are light sleeper as the sound travels easily through the thin party walls.

Imagine being a couple of minutes walk from the Piazza Navona or the Pantheon, a 5 to 10 minutes walk from the Trevi fountain or via del Corso or campo dei Fiori and the ghetto. By extension you\'re also a relatively short walk from the Spanish steps or the Tiber Island or the Forum. We also walked easily to the Vatican via the castle Sant Angelo, to the Colosseum and to the park of the Villa Borghese via its Pincio promenade. So the location is perfect. Then the apartment itself is very well laid out with the living room at its centre, a nice size and functional kitchen (we cooked every day), and the nice bathroom tucked at the end. The balcony is nice to relax while fixing some food. We also used the washing machine, and there is a Carrefour express super handy. The bed is big and comfy. Communication and arrangements were perfect (we had to change our plans at short notice).

The place looks very like the pictures, but there was a leakage of water from the roof all over the balcony so it was very upsetting, and of course we didn\'t expect to find a dog\'s poo on the grass in the balcony... But the rest of the apartment was clean and looked great, and the bed and sofa are comfy.

The apartment is on the road. Lots of noise from outside. Non private garden. The apartment stinks of mold. The owner of the apartment argued and gave no solution. We had to sleep in the hotel. We paid twice the price and did not receive proper value. We are currently drafting a letter to the Airbnb system to request a full refund of the trip. Because we didn\'t stay in the apartment for over an hour. The reactions of the guests before us were misleading. Luckily we continued on a trip we did in Tel Aviv. But with a bad feeling.
